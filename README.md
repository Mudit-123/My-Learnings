# 75 Days Learning Challenge

Welcome to my 75 Days Learning Challenge repository! 

## Overview

This repository documents my 75-day journey of continuous learning in the field of data science and machine learning. Each day is a step forward in acquiring new knowledge, exploring tools, and applying concepts to real-world projects. Join me in this exciting adventure of personal and professional growth!

## Daily Updates

### [Day 1 - Day 25]

- Explored foundational concepts in statistics and mathematics.
- Set up development environment and familiarized myself with essential tools.

### [Day 26 - Day 50]

- Dived into data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing techniques.
- Explored data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### [Day 51 - Day 75]
